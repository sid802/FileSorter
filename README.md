#ShowSorter
Sort many of your files on your computer

Sort Pictures:
If you have many pictures in a directory and want them to be sorted in folders based on their timestamp,
use the PictureSorter!
It takes as parameters your base directory and your group_by key (second/minute/hour/day/month/year) and
redistributes your pictures (or any file really) to folders.
For now, doesn't work recursively yet

Sort Videos:
Takes a folder, and sorts all the TV show
in it based on their name.

For example, Cast×še S01E03 gets moved the
a folder named Castle and sub folder Season 1

This script works TV Show from with two different formats:

1) TVSHOW + S(season) + E(episode) (CastleS01E03)

2) TVSHOW + seasonXepisode (Caste 1x03)
